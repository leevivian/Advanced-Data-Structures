This program computes the product of two matrices using vectors. The user is prompted to enter the dimensions of two matrices, A and B. If the dimensions are not appropriate for matrix multiplication, the user will be asked to re-input their values. The user also inputs the values into the matrices. The multiplied result is printed to the user.
