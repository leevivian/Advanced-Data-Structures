#Vector Functions Program 

Created 9/14/15

This program was compiled on Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2015.

The header file, Header.h, contains libraries and function declarations. The program’s main file, HW1-2Main.cpp calls the functions necessary for following the problem’s instructions. 1.2 Functions.cpp contains the implementations for these functions. It reads the inputted numbers from the user’s keyboard and inserts them into a vector, which is named intVector. The contents of intVector are then sorted in the method selectionSort, which compares each element and swaps their placement based on this comparison of lower versus higher values. The method printVector will print the vector that is present. It is called twice, once after readData, to display the unsorted vector, and once after selectionSort, to display the sorted vector.
